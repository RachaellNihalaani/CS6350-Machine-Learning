## Comparison and Observation - Decision Tree vs AdaBoost  
On comparing Decision Trees with AdaBoost, we can observe that AdaBoost has a better performace and provides more accurate predictions i.e. with less error. Decision Trees are kess accurate due to their high variance and overfitting. This problem is overcome by the boosted classifier AdaBoost.
